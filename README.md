## Description Part
My reason of doing is the school asked me to do, but school has different plans us so I'm going to talk about them mostly.

### Why we did this project?
The reason of us doing this project is mostly learn the C, making our library for our own functions, memory allocation and linked list basics. This project will help people who wrote it in understanding and practicing these subjects.

### Why we should learn library and function links?
We should learn them because in this school we're going to work on big projects like making our own game, own functions and stuff, before we do that we had to understand the core of these standarts.
